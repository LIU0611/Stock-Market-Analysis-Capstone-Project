# Stock-Market-Analysis-Capstone-Project

Capstone Stock Market Analysis Project for Python for Financial Analysis and Algorithmic Trading (Udamy)

We'll be analyzing stock data related to a few car companies, from Jan 1 2012 to Jan 1 2017. Keep in mind that this project is mainly just to practice your skills with matplotlib, pandas, and numpy. Don't infer financial trading advice from the analysis we do here!
